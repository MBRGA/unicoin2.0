Unicoin is a decentralized, smart contract based non-custodial research marketplace which empowers academics to benefit from commercially viable work. Companies can buy direct access to ideas they want to implement and are issued an NFT based licence which represents their access to the papers content. Papers are free for non-compertial usage. Research is always free for open-source and other research projects.
